Highest Score: n/a

This algorithm orders the papers by their score from high to low, and then works through that list from top to bottom and submits valid papers. If the paper has more than one author then it will select the author with the lowest top 5 paper total in order to save the authors with more high scorers for other papers. It will then check if each author has atleast one paper and if not it will try and get their highest scoring paper into the list.
